Hi!, this is my first pip package so sorry if its rough around the edges,

The BetterInstagram package is an 'API like' package used to get information about a users account on instagram(even if they're private)

I say 'API like' because its technically not an API at all although I structured it like one, in reality it acts like a bunch of webscraping macros which is running in the background.

This does make each call slightly slow and instagram may get angy if there are many(alot.) logins, if that does happen i recommend using a vpn(hotspotshield is free and good), but ill try fix this ASAP if this package gets any traction.

Hope you enjoy!
